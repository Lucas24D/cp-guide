      <p class="plain-text"> The objective of this guide is to help everyone who is practicing for competitive programming contests. Although there are many guides that contains lots of information about competitive programming, it still hard to find somewhere a compilation of tutorials from different places. To make it easier to find and study a specific topic, here we present a list with links to lessons and explanations for many of them. We also list extra resources that can help while practicing. You can also contribute to this guide, adding a link to your tutorials or to other non-listed materials<a style="color: rgb(75, 75, 75); font-size:20px; padding=0px; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://github.com/bira37/cp-guide">here</a>by pull request.</p> 
      <p class="plain-text">Each topic is divided into subtopics with tutorials found around the web. All the materials listed are in English or in Portuguese. You don't need to follow it in order. Also, some subtopics from one category can be prerequisite to subtopics from other categories. We assume that you are familiar with basics concepts of programming (like Loops, Arrays, Recursion, Complexity Calculation, Binary Search, etc) and know how to use some structures, like Set, Map, Stack and Queue from C++. Problems for the classic and basic concepts can be easily found on CSES and Neps Academy (listed on extra resources page). For the more advanced topics, most of the tutorials already have suggested problems to solve. Also, more problems can be found on other platforms.</p>
