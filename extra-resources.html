    <h2 class="subtitle">Extra Resources</h2>
    <p class="plain-text"> Here we list some existing resources and tools that complements our guide and could be helpful to anyone who is studying competitive programming.</p> 
    <div class="resources">  
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/23054">An awesome list for competitive programming!</a></li>
        <p>This post published on Codeforces from user Inishan (Jasmine Chen) contains lots of informations, such as places to practice, books about competitive programming and math, tutorial websites, repositories with implementations etc. It's one of the best resources available that can help newcomers and advanced competitors to find what they need.</p>
        <hr class="line-division">
        
        <li><a href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/57282">All of the good tutorials found on codeforces</a></li>
        <p>This post from user Underdog_eagle contains a list of a large number of tutorials found on Codeforces platform. These tutorials contains extra information about some topics, algorithms and tricks that can help all contestants.</p>
        <hr class="line-division">
        
        <li><a href="https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/">URI Online Judge</a></li>
        <p>A website made in Brazil, however it is also available in English, that has a large variety of problems to solve. It is a good platform for newcomers, due to their beginner's category containing lots of easy problems for those who are new in programming.</p>
        <hr class="line-division">
        
        <li><a href="https://cses.fi/problemset/list/">CSES-Code Submission Evaluation System</a></li>
        <p>This website contains some easy and classic problems with short statements, divided by categories. Although it has less problems than most of the websites listed on the first link, it is good for practice new learned techniques and get to know some important topics.</p>
        <hr class="line-division">
        
        <li><a href="https://neps.academy/">Neps Academy</a></li>
        <p>Brazilian Platform that also contains easy and classic problems divided by categories. It also has lessons to basic concepts and topics. It's a good alternative to CSES for Brazilian programmers.</p>
        <hr class="line-division">
        
        <li><a href="https://a2oj.com/">A2 Online Judge</a> and <a href="https://problemclassifier.appspot.com/">Problem Classifier</a></li>
        <p>Good problem classifiers to help searching for problems from a specific category. The first one categorizes problems from various sites and is also an problem solving platform. The second one is only a tool to find specific SPOJ problems and it is nice to use it while navigating through this online judge, which can be a little confusing at first glance without any help.</p>
        <hr class="line-division">
        
        <li><a href="https://github.com/bira37/cp-solutions-library">Competitive Programming Problems' Solution Library</a></li>
        <p>A repository containing solutions for more than 1000 problems until now (mostly from Codeforces) from my own training sessions. It is regularly updated with new problems as soon as I solve them. It is also open for contribution, especially from people who use languages other than C++ (used to solve almost all problems found there), to make it bigger and offer solutions for problems from more platforms, solved using more than one programming language.</p>
